# Krakout-Rebooted

Godot 4.6 reimplementation foundation for Krakout, using the extracted original
assets as the runtime source of truth. The tracked `assets/krakout` tree contains
the Godot-ready textures, audio, level JSON, and a normalized manifest with
`res://` runtime paths plus original extraction provenance.

## Current Slice

- `KrakoutAssets` autoload indexes textures, audio, and level paths from the manifest.
- `KrakoutLevels` autoload loads raw 20x13 board JSON plus the preserved 50-byte
  level tail into `KrakoutLevelData`.
- `KrakoutPlayfieldSpec` centralizes the original 640x480 display and brick-grid
  coordinate constants.
- `KrakoutGameplaySheetCatalog` records the IDA-backed gameplay texture sheets
  and verified dimensions without guessing unknown animation/frame semantics.
- `LevelGridRenderer` renders raw visual board IDs through an isolated IDA-backed
  brick atlas mapping. Most tile gameplay semantics remain intentionally unmapped.
- `PlayfieldRenderer` composes the 640x480 playfield shell from `Backgr`, `Walls`,
  and the selected level board, then creates a mutable board state for gameplay.
- `KrakoutBrickSemantics` and `KrakoutBoardState` preserve the original brick
  active/completion rules plus delayed 3x3 chain explosions for tile IDs 43/68.
- `KrakoutApp` now starts on a Godot `Control` main menu, routes `Start Game`
  into an episode browser backed by decoded episode metadata, and starts the
  selected episode at its first level.
